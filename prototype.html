		<p class="sansserif">Most people share the common love and hate of online shopping. Good things about online shopping such as, Unlimited choice of goodies just a click away eliminates the need to go out of your cozy home and allows to shop more comfortable. Also, if you have to wait at least couple of weeks for delivery, a good chance is, that you've already forgotten about your order, so it's just like getting a present from yourself.  </p>

		<p class="sansserif">All of this sounds great, However, sometimes, online shopping can also leads to a disaster. There are millions of proofs that this perfect story can end up as an online shopping fail, that the products people received are way far from the initial expectation. Buying cosmetic products online is especially risky. Since people are all a wide range of colors and ethnically diverse, the products that fits well on others may not work perfectly on yourself. </p>

		<p class="sansserif">As online customers can't physically access to the cosmetic products, all the product information they get is through digital format. Such as online customer reviews, recommandation from socail influencers, etc. Therefore, receiving products that are different from expectation is really common. While in the real world we don't really have this problem, we can phyisically see the prducts, touch it and test it. Therefore, this "online shopping fail lipstick" is a recreation of that in the real world form.

		<p class="sansserif"> These pictures represent the product information, that people can get through the internet, which all describe the lipstick as perfact, must- have item. As review said " Can't go past it". As a beauty lover, how is it possible to not own one.

		<p class="sansserif"> This lipstick is made up of clay, which represent the disappointment of high expectation through online product information (Rather than represent physically difference, here is more refer to the differnece from expectation. For example, people expect they will look similar to the celebrties as they put on the same lipstick). At the end, what customer received is completely different from what they expected. Compares to the online photo, the physical one look irregular on the surface, more of a pick color, and matte formula. Most importantly, it is definitely not as good as the review said, and not similar as how it looks on the model.

			<p class="sansserif">Therefore, what the cutomers needed for online shopping information is not the inauthentic, perfact images and information, but the testing service that can make online shopping less risky and more enjoyable. Fortunately, Tryon Beauty can make this dream come true! </p>
