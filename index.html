	<p class="sansserif">Tryon Beauty is an online cosmetic shop that have hundreds of cutting edge brand names in cosmetics, skincare, bodycare, etc. Offering the best in global beauty, we aims to help people look and feel their best. With the comprehensive products selections in Tryon Beauty people no longer have to visit every brand’s official website, rather, they can buy various different kinds of brands and products in one single online store. Moreover, we offer “Tryon” function on the website that people can get the idea of how the makeup products will actually look on themselves by uploading their face photo. For example, when shopping lipstick online, various lip colors can be confusing to audience, since they all look someway similar, also it’s hard to tell if the color fits without physically have the product. Therefore, with Tryon Beauty, people can upload their photo, choose the color they are interested in, and see how it actually look on themselves.</p> 
	<p class="sansserif">My inspiration of this “tryon” function is from the makeup app. In the makeup app, people can put on makeup on their digital image. As a result, I think of the idea of combining the cosmetic website with makeup app, that people can on the one side enjoy the quick and simple online shopping, on the other side, benefit the testing function when shopping in store. From my personal experience, “no testing” is always the biggest disadvantage when shopping online. As customers are all a wide range of colours and ethnically diverse it can be difficult to determine a perfect match without giving it a try in-store. This can not only result in a waste of time,that people have to search a lot of online review of the products, but also a waste of money, that struggling to find a correct match, and end up receiving the product that does not meet the expectation.Therefore, combining the makeup app with online shop, people will no longer having issue when doing cosmetic shopping, rather, it can be convenient and enjoyable.  </p>
